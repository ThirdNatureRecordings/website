      <p>Third Nature Recordings is a co-operative record label run by its artists. It works much like other independent labels, but with 4 key differences:
<br><br>
1. It is owned by its artists, contributors and community.<br>
2. 100% of its profits are reinvested into its artists.<br>
3. Decisions are made by a board of all artists on the label.<br>
4. We are transparent about finances and how we operate.<br><br>

Inspired by solidarity economics and established co-operative principles, Third Nature aims to contribute to a new kind of artist-controlled and financially transparent label structure that is vitally essential to the creative communities of our current time.
<br><br>
At TNR, artists aren’t ‘signed’, they become Artist-Members, people that do work for us can become Contributor-Members, and fans that join the co-op become Community-Members.
<br><br>
Most importantly though, we aim to support and share interesting musical explorations from Wales and beyond, and become an outlet for the eclectic breadths of its artists.
<br><br>
