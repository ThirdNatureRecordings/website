  <p> Third Nature is a co-operative record label run by its artists. <br>It works much like other independent labels, but with 4 key differences: <br><br>

(1) It is owned by its artists and contributors. <br>(2) 100% of profits are reinvested into our artists. <br>(3) Decisions are made by a board of members.
<br>(4) We are transparent about how we operate.<br><br>

Inspired by solidarity economics and established co-operative principles, Third Nature aims to contribute to a new kind of artist-controlled and financially transparent label structure that is vitally essential to the creative communities of our current time. 
<br><br>
At TNR, artists aren’t ‘signed’, they become Artist-Members, people that do work for us can become Contributor-Members, and fans that join the co-op become Community-Members. 
<br><br>
Most importantly though, we aim to support and share interesting musical explorations from Wales and beyond, and become an outlet for the eclectic breadths of its artists.
