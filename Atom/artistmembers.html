<p>
Third Nature Recordings is a co-operative record label run by its artists. <br>
It works much like other small independent labels, but with 4 key differences:<br><br>

1. It is owned by its artists, contributors and community.<br>
2. 100% of its profits are reinvested into its artists.<br>
3. Decisions are made by a board of all artists on the label.<br>
4. We are transparent about finances and <a href="https://third-nature.gitbook.io/third-nature/">how we operate</a>.<br><br>

Inspired by solidarity economics and established co-operative principles, <br>
Third Nature aims to contribute to a new kind of artist-controlled and <br>
financially transparent label structure that is vitally essential to the <br>
creative communities of our current time.<br><br>

In the long term, we hope co-operative label structures will catch on as a <br>
viable model for music scenes everywhere, joining a network of artist <br>
cooperatives that offer a practical alternative to both the bland conformity<br>
of media megacorps and the financial insolvency of many DIY operations.<br><br>

At TNR, artists aren’t ‘signed’, they become Artist-Members,<br>
people that do work for us can become Contributor-Members, <br>
and fans that want to join the co-op become Community-Members.<br><br>
