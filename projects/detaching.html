   A sample pack featuring 145 sounds and the result of a collaboration between Popular Music students at the University of Gloucestershire, investigating the role of music for social change. Inspired by the blog post <a href="https://klangmag.co/sample-packing-as-social-practice/">'Sample Packing as Social Practice'</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/la_meme_young/?hl=en">Max Alper</a>, the students produced a suite of sounds with the intention of making them publicly available. 
        <br><br>
        The pack features environmental recordings of several places selected by the students, and include a variety of textures, pops, and klangs.
        Samples are organised alphabetically, and named after the action taking place in the recording.
