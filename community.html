<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Community-Membership</h2>
  
<br>  
    
<p>  
Third Nature Recordings was set up in an effort to give artists more of a say in how the label structure operates.  As a co-operative, artists and contributors at Third Nature collectively share ownership of the label and work together towards a shared vision of a more equitable future. 
<br><br>
 
<h2 style="font-size: 12px; color: #5959EF;"><b>Here, we’re inviting anyone passionate about our artists and our vision to join us as a Community-Member.</b></h2>

<br><br>
Alongside artists and contributors, Community-Members will support our mission, allow us to more quickly invest in our artists' work, and help us grow the label to offer more artists the opporutniy to gain ownership of the label to which they are ’signed’.
<br><br>
This membership model of governance rights is a way to align accountability to our members and sustain ourselves in a grassroots way. In other words, this allows us to be accountable only to you and to each other—not venture capitalists.
<br><br>
  
<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">What it means to be a community member</h2>
