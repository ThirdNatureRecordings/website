<p>  
Third Nature Recordings was set up in an effort to give artists more of a say in how the label operates.  As a co-operative, artists and contributors at Third Nature collectively share ownership of the label and work together towards a shared vision of a more equitable future. 
<br><br>
<b>Here, we’re inviting anyone passionate about our artists and our vision to join us as a Community-Member.</b> 
<br><br>
Alongside Artists and Contributors, Community-Members will support our mission, allow us to more quickly invest in our artists work, and help us grow the label to offer more artists gain ownership of the label to which they are ’signed’.
<br><br>
This membership model of governance rights is a way to align accountability to our members and sustain ourselves in a grassroots way. In other words, this allows us to be accountable only to you and to each other—not venture capitalists.
<br><br>
  </p>

  <h3>What it means to be a community member</h3>
<br><br>
<p>As a community member you’ll officially become part of the Third Nature co-op. That means you’ll not only receive the emotional reward of supporting an artist- and worker-owned organisation, you’ll also get to say in how we grow.
<br><br>
As part of the co-op you’ll receive:
<br><br>
  <b>* A seat at the table:</b> Community-Members will have a seat of elected representation on our board of directors. You can vote ion important decisions as well as our board elections, or nominate yourself to be on the board. 
<br><br>
  <b>* Access to all releases:</b> You’ll unlock access to our back catalogue and any future releases while you are a member.  
<br><br>
  <b>* Discounts and exclusive content:</b> Community-Members qualify for discounts on merchandise and live show tickets, and access to exclusive member-only content. 
<br><br>
  </p>

  <h3>How to become a community member</h3>
<br><br>
<p>Head to and click “Support What You Want,” then go through the flow. Community-Member support begins at £30 a year, but you can also select a higher amount if you want.
<br><br>
By standing with Third Nature as a Community-Member, you send a powerful signal that artist solidarity and worker power can win over VC pressures and exploitation in tech.
