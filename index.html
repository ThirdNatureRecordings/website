    Third Nature produces forward thinking music projects, and is built on the principle that cooperation creates healthier music communities.
      <br><br>
    Guided by mutualist values and perspectives on eco-feminism, Third Nature fosters collaboration, knowledge sharing, and ecological interdependence among artists, allowing for flexible participation and decentralised decision-making.
      <br><br>
    Embracing a cooperative-community model, Third Nature combines the stability of a core co-op structure with the flexibility of an inclusive, open-ended community.
