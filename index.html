<p>
Third Nature Recordings is a co-operative record label run by its artists.
It works much like other independent labels, but with 4 key differences:<br><br>

1. It is owned by its artists, contributors and community.<br>
2. 100% of its profits are reinvested into its artists.<br>
3. Decisions are made by a board of all artists on the label.<br>
4. We are transparent about finances and <a href="https://third-nature.gitbook.io/third-nature/">how we operate</a>.<br><br>

Inspired by solidarity economics and established co-operative principles,
Third Nature aims to contribute to a new kind of artist-controlled and
financially transparent label structure that is vitally essential to the
creative communities of our current time.<br><br>

At TNR, artists aren’t ‘signed’, they become Artist-Members,
people that do work for us can become Contributor-Members,
and fans that join the co-op become Community-Members.<br><br>

Most importantly though, we aim to support and share interesting
musical explorations from Wales and beyond, and become an outlet
for the eclectic breadths of its artists.<br><br>
